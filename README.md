# Force Masters: Free Body Diagram Game

An interactive educational game designed to help Hong Kong F.2 students learn about free body diagrams through gamified learning.

## Overview

Force Masters is a web-based physics game that visualizes free body diagrams in real-time. Students can interact with various forces, see how they affect objects, and learn the principles of physics in an engaging way.

## Features

- Interactive physics simulation using Matter.js
- Real-time free body diagram visualization
- Progressive levels with increasing complexity
- Immediate feedback on force applications
- Educational content aligned with Hong Kong F.2 physics curriculum

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
3. No additional installation or setup is required!

## Game Instructions

1. **Objective**: Create correct free body diagrams for each physics scenario
2. **Controls**:
   - Click on force buttons in the control panel to add/remove forces
   - The free body diagram updates in real-time
   - Complete each level by adding all required forces
3. **Levels**:
   - Level 1: Box on a flat surface
   - Level 2: Box with applied force and friction
   - Level 3: Object on an inclined plane

## Educational Benefits

- Makes abstract physics concepts tangible and visual
